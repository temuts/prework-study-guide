## Usage

The listed manner in which the notes are organized provides easy readying for the major topics of the Coding Bootcamp Pre-Work. Because the Pre-Work is comprehensive, the different headers and ways to organize the various sections covered in all three modules will assist students in organizing their ideas and notes. This framework also allows student to add on to it at future times if they would like, or alter already input notes. Students can refer to this webpage when they are far from their personal workspace, as it can be accessed on any browser when published.
